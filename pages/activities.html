                    <p>The first stakeholder meeting was held from July 16 to 19, 2024, in Otjiwarongo, Namibia, with approximately 100 participants. The gathering facilitated the sharing of knowledge and information on local, national, and regional indigenous initiatives and activities. The objectives were to promote indigenous languages and knowledge, integrate these into global climate science and policy processes, strengthen cooperation, and explore ways to align national priorities with the local implementation of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages.</p>

                    <p>A session held in Donkerbos brought together 32 participants (15 males and 17 females) to discuss the National Action Plan (NAP) with a focus on the preservation and revitalization of traditional practices and the Ju/'hoan language. The community discussed the role of media in preserving and promoting their Indigenous Language and culture. They emphasised the need to broadcast radio and TV content in the different Khoesan languages to engage a broader audience and maintain linguistic integrity. Suggestions included creating a platform for undiluted language content, developing arts such as poetry, songs, and traditional games in both written and digital formats, and documenting cultural elements like stories, songs, and activities to be used as educational resources. Community members also discussed the importance of integrating Khoesan languages into all levels of education, training teachers from within the community, and addressing discriminatory policies that restrict cultural expressions in schools. Discussions also highlighted the need to incorporate traditional health practices into modern systems and ensure the presence of Khoesan -speaking healthcare workers. Moreover, they called for government engagement to ensure accurate representation of indigenous identities, including the proper spelling of traditional names, underscoring the importance of cultural preservation in shaping the community's future.</p>

                    <h3>Ovahimba Community in Otjisa, Kunene Region</h3>
                    <p>In September 2024, a National Action Plan (NAP) session with the Ovahimba community in Otjisa, Kunene, was held with 23 participants, including 10 females and 13 males. The discussions centered on the communities' efforts to maintain their Indigenous culture and Language, highlighting critical challenges in doing so. The community explained the importance of their traditional attire and language as the core of their identity, expressing concerns about youth losing fluency due to schooling systems that neglect their language but also their ingrained value system. They discussed the need for teaching the language in schools by fluent speakers and for teachers to understand the culture, with an emphasis on the value system which they could learn from the community. Similarly, traditional attire, particularly the use of otjize (red ochre paste), faces stigma in schools, prompting calls for acceptance and protection of cultural expressions.</p>
